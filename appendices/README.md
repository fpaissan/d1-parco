### Appendix

This folder contains the additional results extracted during the project.

In [here](appendices/plots/symm), you can find all the results for the different strategies, optimization levels, and the number of threads.
The filename reports all the information regarding the kernel that it represents. The notation is aligned with what is presented in the paper.

In [here](appendices/plots/tra), you can find the same results for the matrix transposition kernels.

The complete analysis of the trends is presented in [here](appendices/plots/trends) for both the varying number of threads and optimization flags.

The kernel throughput is summarized [in this plot](appendices/plots/peak_performance.pdf).
